# Compass Overview

Compass is an open-source implementation of an IOTA Network coordinator. It is used to ensure the Tangle it is connected to is moving in a uniform direction and to protect against various attacks a young Tangle is susceptible to.

**Making Compass obsolete**
Considerable research is underway towards a viable replacement for the Coordinator. Releasing Compass, an open source coordinator, will further this research.
