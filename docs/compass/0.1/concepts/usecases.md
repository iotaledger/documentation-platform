# Compass Use Cases

Compass is useful for enabling private Tangles for anyone wanting to look at the IOTA protocol.

- **Security researchers** could use Compass to create a private Tangle to conduct security testing and research. This enables them a controlled environment to test assumptions and produce attacks.

- **Developers** could use Compass to create a private Tangle to develop applications in environment with unlimited tokens to manipulate.

- **Corporates** could use Compass to develop a Proof of Concept application without sharing their technology. It allows them to test and debug in private until they are ready to launch their application on the permissionless [IOTA Mainnet](#).
