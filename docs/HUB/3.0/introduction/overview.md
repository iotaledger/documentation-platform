# Hub Overview

IOTA Hub is a multi-user-wallet used by those with custody of other’s tokens and those requiring the secure management of IOTA tokens. Companies can use Hub to manage the complicated tasks associated with deposits and withdrawals of IOTA. 

Hub was developed with security in mind and includes a number of options to protect tokens in the Hub. These include test coverage, separated signing servers, and secure gRPC connections.

Hub was developed as a standalone module, separate from the IOTA Node or Client software, to allow for easy integration into existing software environments.
