# IRI configuration options

**This table contains the configuration options for the IRI.**

You can choose to configure the IRI by specifying the configuration options in the following ways:
* As flags in the command line
* As parameters in a file with the .iri extension (IRI configuration file)

| **Configuration options** |   **Description**| **Accepted values** | **Default values**|**Notes** |

|  <a name="maxdepth"></a>`--max-depth` |Maximum number of previous milestones (depth) from where the IRI will start the tip selection |number |15 | This value should be both small enough to allow the weighted random walk to finish in a reasonable amount of time and large enough in include enough new transactions in the [subgraph](../concepts/tip-selection.md#subgraph-selection)

|<a name="p-propagate-request"></a>`--p-propagate-request` |Probability of the IRI requesting a missing transaction from a neighbor | number|0.01 | This number should be low to avoid the IRI requesting non-existing transactions that spam the network
|<a name="p-remove-request"></a>`--p-remove-request` |Probability of the IRI stopping to request a transaction |number between 0 and 1 |0.01 |This number should be close to 0 so that non-existing transaction hashes are eventually removed

|<a name="p-select-milestone"></a>`--p-select-milestone`| Probability of the IRI requesting a milestone transaction from a neighbor|number between 0 and 1 | 0.7|This number should be a large because it's essential that the IRI finds milestones in order to consider transactions confirmed
|<a name="p-send-milestone"></a>`--p-send-milestone` |Probability of the IRI sending a milestone transaction as a random transaction to its neighbors | number between 0 and 1 | 0.02|
|<a name="port"></a>`--port, -p` (**required**) |Port that will be used by clients' API connections |string |14265 |

|<a name="remote-limit-api"></a>`--remote-limit-api` |API calls that the IRI must ignore |array of strings |[addNeighbors, getNeighbors, removeNeighbors, attachToTangle, interruptAttachToTangle] | This option allows you to protect your IRI node against spammers that know the IRI node's URL or IP address.

|<a name="zmq-port"></a> `--zmq-port `|Port that is used to connect to the ZMQ feed |string | 5556|
|<a name="local-snapshots-enabled"></a>`LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_ENABLED`   | Enable [local snapshots](../concepts/local-snapshot.md) |boolean  | true  | This parameter must be set to `true` for the IRI to read any other `LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS` parameters|
|<a name="local-snapshots-pruning-enabled"></a>`LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_PRUNING_ENABLED`  |  Enable the deletion of transactions from the ledger  | true | Transactions are deleted if they were confirmed by a milestone with an index that is older than the result of the following calculation: current milestone index - (`LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_DEPTH` + `LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_PRUNING_DELAY`).  |
|<a name="local-snapshots-depth"></a>`LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_DEPTH`  | Amount of seen milestones to record in the snapshot.meta file | number starting from 100 | 100 | |
|<a name="local-snapshots-pruning-delay"></a>`LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_PRUNING_DELAY`  | Amount of milestone transactions to keep in the ledger   | number starting from 10,000  | 40,000 | We recommend that you use the default value for this option, which triggers a local snapshot around every 28 days.  |
|<a name="local-snapshots-interval-synced"></a>`LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_INTERVAL_SYNCED`  | Interval, in milestone transactions, at which snapshot files are created if the ledger is fully synchronized  |number| 10   | |
|<a name="local-snapshots-interval-unsynced"></a>`LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_INTERVAL_UNSYNCED`   | Interval, in milestone transactions, at which snapshot files are created if the ledger is not fully synchronized  |number| 1,000  | This value is higher than the `LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_INTERVAL_SYNCED` configuration option to allow the IRI to focus its resources on synchronizing with its neighbor IRI nodes|
|<a name="local-snapshots-base-path"></a>`LOCAL_SNAPSHOTS_BASE_PATH`  |  Path to the snapshot file, without the file extension. |  string |  mainnet   | Prepends the `.snapshot.meta` and `.snapshot.state` files with the value of this parameter. For the default value, the files are named `mainnet.snapshot.meta` and `mainnet.snapshot.state`. You can specify a directory for the files to be added to by doing the following: `<directory name>/<file name>`, which results in `folderpath/filename.snapshot.meta`. | |
